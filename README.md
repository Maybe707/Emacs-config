# Emacs-config
My custom Emacs vanilla config with C/C++, Rust, Lisp and Haskell support. Also with custom dark color scheme.

Clone config files in `$HOME/.emacs.d` directory that Emacs using as start point to load from.

    git clone https://github.com/Maybe707/Emacs-config.git "$HOME/.emacs.d"

After cloning config files you just need to install package that called package-use:
- Press Alt + x and then enter `list-packages` command.
- Press Ctrl + s for forward searching and type use-package.
- Press "Enter" on use-package name and then switch to opened buffer with Ctrl + o combination.
- Press install button.
